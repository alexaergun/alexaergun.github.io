      <p>Hello I'm Alexandria, currently I am a student at the University of Denver studying to become a Full Stack Web Developer. My main goal is gain more experience in coding, thus being able to build a brighter future for my husband and myself. I would love to move out of Colorado and explore other states that benefit my career path; Austin, Texas being my first choice.</p>

      <p>I currently have my certificate in Bartending, a bachelor degree in Pastry Arts, and I am also N.R.A. Certified. Coding is a heavy skill that I am exploring, and I'm grateful for the vast knowledge I'm earning. When not focused on studies I enjoy baking and cooking, fishing, playing with my 3 cats, hanging out with my Turkish husband, watching movies, going on outdoor adventures, and making modifications to my husbands or my own vehicles.</p>
